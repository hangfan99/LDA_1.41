# Latent Data Assimilation for Global Atmosphere (1.41Â° resolution)

This repository contains the implementation of latent data assimilation (LDA) methods for the global atmosphere at a horizontal resolution of 1.41 degrees.

## Contents

- âœ… Autoencoder (AE) architecture
- âœ… OSSE-based experiments using:
  - Latent 3D-Var (L3DVar)
  - Latent 4D-Var (L4DVar)
- ðŸ“„ Example notebook: [`LDA_OSSE.ipynb`](./DA_exps/LDA_OSSEs.ipynb)

## Availability

Part of the code has been released. The complete implementation will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the associated manuscript.
